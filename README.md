It’s necessary to create an audit checklist before conducting an audit. A checklist is generally made up of the following areas of focus:

**Identify the scope of the audit**
 
The audit should:

List assets that will be assessed (e.g., firewalls are configured correctly, PII is secure, physical assets are locked, etc.) 

Note how the audit will help the organization achieve its desired goals

Indicate how often an audit should be performed

Include an evaluation of organizational policies, protocols, and procedures to make sure they are working as intended and being implemented by employees

**Complete a risk assessment**

A risk assessment is used to evaluate identified organizational risks related to budget, controls, internal processes, and external standards (i.e., regulations).

**Conduct the audit**

When conducting an internal audit, you will assess the security of the identified assets listed in the audit scope.

**Create a mitigation plan**

A mitigation plan is a strategy established to lower the level of risk and potential costs, penalties, or other issues that can negatively affect the organization’s security posture. 

**Communicate results to stakeholders**

The end result of this process is providing a detailed report of findings, suggested improvements needed to lower the organization's level of risk, and compliance regulations and standards the organization needs to adhere to.
